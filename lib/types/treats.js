/**
 * Treat (小鱼干) economy — pure, clock-injected. The pet's food comes from
 * two sources, both tied to companionship:
 *  - work output: every N completed turns grant one treat;
 *  - time output: every T minutes of wall-clock time grant one treat.
 * Difficulty tuned deliberately high (10x the original cadence): treats are
 * a rare delicacy the pet earns through sustained companionship, not a
 * routine drop.
 * Feeding consumes one treat. Settlement is lazy: it runs whenever the host
 * serves a state snapshot or an interaction, so there is no timer and no
 * drift — elapsed periods are computed from the persisted last-grant marks.

 * are independent so a continuously working user still earns time treats.
 * 0 time history never backfills — the clock starts at the first settlement,
 * and even a zero-gain first settlement writes the time anchor so the next
