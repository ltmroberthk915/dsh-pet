/**
 * Status-decoration manifest v1 — fail-closed structure + warn-and-drop
 * content, mirroring the pet manifest-v2 discipline (issue #623 M5,
 * protocol #567). Unknown top-level fields, unsafe entry paths, out-of-
 * range geometry and unknown renderer content reject the descriptor with
 * human-readable diagnostics; per-phase binding issues drop that binding
 * only. The JSON Schema twin lives at
 * contracts/status-decoration-v1.schema.json; this hand-rolled parser is
 * authoritative. Keep this file erasable-syntax-only (scripts/ import it
 * under node's strip-only mode).
