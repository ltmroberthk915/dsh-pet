/**
 * Pet HTTP routes — the browser half talks to the host through plain
 * same-origin JSON endpoints ('/api/pet/*') and loads pet assets from
 * '/pet/<id>/*'. The '/plugins/' endpoint only serves client bundles and RPC
 * domains are platform-registered, so the pet serves its own API and media —
 * the same pattern as dsh-remote-web-ui's '/api/pair' family. The asset route
 * is one prefix registration serving every registry entry (manifest, atlas,
 * optional previews), so adding a pet never touches route wiring. Both the
 * JSON API, the asset prefix, and the Live2D runtime prefix are loopback-only
 * by default; a live paired-device cookie is an extra allow path when
 * remote-web-ui is loaded.
 * @module dsh-pet-copilot/routes
