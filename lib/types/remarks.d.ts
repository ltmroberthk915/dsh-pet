/**
 * Pet remark (reaction copy) library — pure. Reaction bubbles the pet speaks
 * on interaction events come from two layers:
 *  - the built-in default library below (a generous pool per event kind);
 *  - per-pet custom lines declared in a manifest's 'remarks' block, which
 *    community pet contributions (PRs) use to give their pet its own voice.
 * A custom slot replaces the built-in pool for that slot only; the other
 * slots keep the built-in lines. Picks cycle round-robin within a pool so
 * repeated interactions stay varied while tests stay deterministic (no
 * randomness, no clock).
